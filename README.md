## Install extension manually
- [Download the latest release zip file for your browser](https://github.com/charleskimbac/roblox-profile-notes/releases).
  - If you decide to download source code instead:
    - Extract the folder and find the `[browser].manifest.json` files.  
    - *Remove* the `[browser].` in the filename for the browser you are installing onto.
    - Example: if you're on Chrome (Chromium), then rename `chrome.manifest.json` to `manifest.json`.
- Extract and open the folder.
  - Another lone folder (that holds all the files) should be inside.
- Move the lone folder to a safe place where it won't get deleted accidentally (e.g. `Documents`).
- Go to your browser extension manager or enter `chrome://extensions/` (or equivalent) into your address bar.
- Enable `Developer Mode`.
- Click `Load Unpacked`.
- Select the inner extracted folder.
  - Ensure this is the direct folder that has files inside of it and that this folder doesn't contain another folder.
